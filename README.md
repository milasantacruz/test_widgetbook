# FLUTTER INSTALLATION

## Getting Started (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/desktop)

 2) Launch VS Code.

    To open the Command Palette, press Control + Shift + P.

    In the Command Palette, type flutter.

    Select Flutter: New Project.

    VS Code prompts you to locate the Flutter SDK on your computer.

        If you have the Flutter SDK installed, click Locate SDK.

        If you do not have the Flutter SDK installed, click Download SDK.
